# 📸 Oldagram

Hello there! 👋
Oldagram is a fun and stylish photo feed built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, inspired by classic social media timelines.

Originally a basic DOM manipulation challenge, I decided to expand it into a fully functional, dynamic UI. It renders posts from an array of objects and includes interactivity like a working “like” button — all without relying on any frameworks or libraries.
