# 📸 Oldagram

Hello there! 👋
Oldagram is a fun and stylish photo feed built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, inspired by classic social media timelines.

Originally a basic DOM manipulation challenge, I decided to expand it into a fully functional, dynamic UI. It renders posts from an array of objects and includes interactivity like a working “like” button — all without relying on any frameworks or libraries.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Shows avatars, images, usernames, locations, likes, and comments
- ✅ Lets users click a heart icon to increase the like count per post
- ✅ Clean layout and responsive design using Flexbox
- ✅ Built entirely with semantic HTML and modular CSS classes
